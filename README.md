# Godot Project Template

This is a snapshot of my preferred starting point for a new Godot project.

It sets up the following:
 * .gitignore
 * Disable annoying GDScript warnings
 * Adds the Godot Notes plugin (with a minor bug fix)
 * Adds the CodeSnippetPopup plugin with custom default code snippets

## CodeSnippetPopup usage

Press Ctrl+T to invoke the popup. The snippets can be filtered by a search string. Ending the search string with " X" will jump to the X-th item in the snippet list.

Press Ctrl+T to jump to the next marker.

## Godot Notes usage

You can drag the Notes panel to combine it with other panels. I put it with Inspector and Node.
