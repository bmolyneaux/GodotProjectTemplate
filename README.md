# Godot Project Template

This is a snapshot of my preferred starting point for a new Godot project.

It sets up the following:
 * .gitignore
 * Disable annoying GDScript warnings
 * Adds the Godot Notes plugin (with a minor bug fix)
 * Adds the CodeSnippetPopup plugin with custom default code snippets
